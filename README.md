# evpcd-4
New 4th version of evpcd, specifically revision 2. So 4.2.0
The main difference really is that it's a single header file, and C compatible.
check evpcdp.hpp for a C++ wrapper, though it's quite useless unless you're working with arduino

Notes: this is barely organized and not exactly great. I Highly advise users to make their own
changes to avoid any vulnerabilities in the system or bugs/errors, because they're more than "likely"
If you do infact make these changes, it'll be highly appreciated if you make a pull request for the main
branch to have these changes.
